    RTOSs provide safety and predictability to the system they support.
    The ability to meet deadlines when responding to external events is
        necessary for hard real-time systems and crucial for soft ones.
    The price for this assurance is increased complexity, cost, and development
        time.
    Alternatively, Linux-based operating systems feature a suite of tools for
        handling soft real-time requirements.
    And, by virtue of the Linux kernel being open source, it can be extended to
        further meet real-time requirements by developers with expert Linux
        knowledge.
    Deciding whether to switch from a Linux distribution to a RTOS involves
        analyzing the benefits of a RTOS and balancing them with their
        associated costs.
    These benefits and tradeoffs between will be discussed here.
    But first, it must be acknowledged that there is a high degree of overlap
        between the two, especially regarding soft real-time systems.

            When utilizing Linux for real-time systems, there are generally two
                options.
            The first is to use the real-time capabilities built into the Linux
                kernel.
            One such capability is a patch to the kernel that makes it fully
                preemptible.
            The second option is to use a real-time framework for the Linux
                kernel.
            Three such frameworks are discussed, all of which function by adding
                a \textit{co-kernel} in a addition to the Linux kernel.

                The real-time features of the Linux kernel revolve around
                    \textit{preemption}---pausing a running process to run a
                    higher-priority process instead.
                In user-mode, any process can be preempted, transferring control
                    to the kernel for scheduling \cite{ubuntu-real-time-part2}.
                The preemption strategy for kernel mode is where the potential
                    for real-time Linux lies.
                Mainline Linux (the vanilla version of the Linux kernel not
                    associated with any specific distribution) offers three
                    preemption strategies for the kernel:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item
                        \textbf{PREEMPT\_NONE} forbids preemption when in
                            kernel mode; system call returns and interrupts are
                            the only preemption points
                            \cite{linux-preemption-models}.
                    \item
                        \textbf{PREEMPT\_VOLUNTARY} allows low-priority
                            processes to voluntarily preempt themselves when
                            executing a system call in kernel mode
                            \cite{ubuntu-real-time-part3}.
                    \item
                        \textbf{PREEMPT} makes all kernel code preemptible,
                        except for critical sections
                        \cite{linux-preemption-models}.
                \end{itemize}

                The fully preemptible kernel (the \textbf{PREEMPT\_RT} patch)
                    takes preemption further.
                This patch aimed to give Linux even more real-time capabilities.
                Although not part of mainline Linux, this patch is backed by the
                    Linux Foundation and is in use for real-time systems
                    \cite{rt-linux-riscv}.
                This preemption strategy further increases the number of
                    preemption points in kernel code and uses more real-time
                    data structures when handling interrupts and threads
                    \cite{linux-preemption-models}.

                The fully preemptible Linux kernel can be utilized in
                    high-performance computing and embedded industrial
                    environments.
                For complex real-time systems this kernel configuration provides
                    real-time capabilities within the familiarity of a
                    Linux-based operating system.
                The primary caveat is that there is no formal guarantee of worst
                    case execution times, and thus cannot be used for
                    safety-critical real-time systems \cite{preempt-rt-survey}.

                Other than the fully preemptible Linux kernel, the most common
                    approach to adapting the Linux kernel to real-time
                    environments involves using a real-time framework that adds
                    a co-kernel to the Linux kernel.
                The idea is to have the co-kernel working as a layer between the
                    hardware and the Linux kernel.
                The co-kernel is responsible for catching hardware interrupts,
                    scheduling them as either real-time tasks or Linux tasks,
                    and guaranteeing that real-time tasks meet their deadline.
                Leftover CPU time is given back to the Linux kernel
                    \cite{preempt-rt-survey}.

                The most common open-source implementations of a real-time
                    co-kernel Linux framework are RTLinux, Xenomai, and the Real
                    Time Application Interface for Linux (RTAI).

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item
                        \textbf{RTLinux} runs the Linux kernel as a
                            fully-preemptible process \cite{preempt-rt-survey}.
                        It then intercepts all hardware interrupts and schedules
                            tasks.
                        Shown in \fig{rtlinux_structure}, hardware interrupts
                            not related to real-time events are passed to the
                            Linux kernel as software interrupts, whereas
                            real-time event interrupts are handled by the
                            appropriate real-time interrupt service routines
                            \cite{rt-linux-getting-started}.

                        \textbf{Xenomai} works by supplementing the Linux kernel
                            with a real-time kernel running side-by-side with
                            it \cite{xenomai-overview}.
                        The real-time core deals with all time-critical
                            tasks and has a higher priority than the Linux
                            kernel.
                        The Xenomai kernel and the Linux kernel communicate via
                            the
                            \textit{Adaptive Domain Environment for Operating System (ADEOS)},
                            which separate domains for both kernels
                            \cite{preempt-rt-survey}.
                        This is shown in \fig{xenomai_structure}.

                            interrupts \cite{xenomai-overview}.

                The fully preemptible Linux kernel and real-time Linux kernel
                    frameworks both add real-time capabilities to the Linux
                    kernel.
                The fully preemptible kernel achieves this by allowing the
                    kernel to be preempted in kernel mode and utilizing
                    real-time data structures \cite{linux-preemption-models}.
                However, these modifications are not enough to accommodate the
                    needs of a hard real-time system \cite{preempt-rt-survey}.
                At its core, the PREEMPT\_RT patch is still the Linux kernel,
                    offering no guarantees on worst case execution time
                    \cite{preempt-rt-survey}.
                This approach should only be taken for soft real-time systems.
                In this use case, the most important advantage of using the
                    fully preemptible Linux kernel is the cost and speed of
                    development.
                PREEMPT\_RT Linux does not differ much from mainline Linux.
                This allows the wealth of code for drivers and libraries in
                    Linux to be reused---although they may need to be adapted to
                    fit real-time needs.
                Further, many software engineers are competent with Linux and
                    can handle developing with the PREEMPT\_RT patch
                    \cite{preempt-rt-survey}.

                When tighter deadlines are required, a co-kernel Linux framework
                    can be used.
                These frameworks do have the ability to handle hard real-time
                    requirements \cite{preempt-rt-survey}.
                The cost of this functionality is development time and
                    complexity.
                Co-kernel approaches require modifications of the Linux kernel
                    code, none of which are fully backed by the
                    Linux community.
                This also introduces a dependency on the specific Linux kernel
                    version being modified, often being an older version
                    \cite{preempt-rt-survey}.
                The complex interaction between the two kernels introduces a
                    level of complexity that needs to be handled by skilled
                    real-time developers, increasing development efforts
                    \cite{preempt-rt-survey}.
                As a result, real-time Linux frameworks should be used only when
                    necessary, preferring the fully preemptible kernel when
                    timing requirements allow it.

            They have different use cases when compared with each other, and

                The main advantage of using the Linux kernel for real time
                    systems is the ease of development.
                Many software engineers are familiar with Linux and can quickly
                    learn how to use the real-time capabilities of the kernel.
                Soft real-time systems can make use of the fully preemptible
                    kernel, while hard real-time systems require a framework
                    that modifies the kernel.
                However, real-time Linux-based operating systems, whether it is
                    the fully preemptible kernel or a real-time kernel
                    framework, require the memory space and processing power to
                    run a full Linux operating system.
                This is a luxury that many embedded systems simply do not have
                    \cite{rtos-overview}.
                Apart from very large systems that can take support a full Linux
                    kernel, another solution is needed.

                For hard real-time embedded systems with limited resources, a
                    non-Linux RTOS is the only option (aside from writing
                    bare-metal code for the hardware without an operating
                    system).
                Commercial RTOSs are the most popular choice for this scenario.
                These are RTOSs developed and maintained by a private company.
                While they have a high up-front cost, and may even charge
                    royalties for deployment of the system, they alleviate
                    in-house development costs and provide a high level of
                    trust \cite{rtos-overview}.
                Open-source RTOSs also exist, allowing access to the source code
                    of the operating system.
                Although the source code is freely obtained, long-term support
                    is often needed and must be purchased \cite{rtos-overview}.
                This support can come from the maintainers and user community of
                    the operating system, or from hired software engineers.
                To further add to the cost, low-level development tools are
                    often needed to work with these RTOSs and must be purchased
                    for the engineers \cite{rtos-overview}.

                Choosing an RTOS is a technical decision that must take into
                    account the system requirements and timing deadlines that
                    the operating system must be able to handle.
                This information must be balanced with the cost of purchasing
                    and maintaining the system, which will introduce a cost
                    whether the engineers are hired or not.
                Ultimately, the decision is very specific to the situation being

                Before concluding, some examples of non-Linux RTOSs will be
                    discussed to provide a more detailed view of the real-time
                    software ecosystem.

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item
                        \textbf{VxWorks} is a commercial RTOS that is the most
                            popular in the embedded industry
                            \cite{rtos-overview}.
                        Some notable uses of VxWorks include the Mars Curiosity
                            rover \cite{vsworks-curiosity} and the International
                            Space Station \cite{rtos-overview}.
                        VxWorks supports many development hosts and can run on
                            all popular CPU platforms.
                    \item
                        \textbf{Embedded Configurable Operating System (eCos)}
                            is the most popular open source RTOS.
                        \sloppy It provides a configuration tool available in
                            both graphical and command-line formats to specify
                            the system's requirements \cite{rtos-overview}.
                        The focus of eCos is on configurability.
                        It can scale from extremely small memory-constrained
                            systems to large systems with complex functionality
                            \cite{ecos-overview}.
                        There are fewer supported development hosts and CPU
                            platforms with eCos than with VxWorks, but it still
                            offers the expected operating system functionality
                            and real-time capabilities \cite{rtos-overview}.
                    \item
                        \textbf{HartOs} is a research project that is attempting
                            to implement a RTOS at the hardware level
                            \cite{hartos}.
                        HartOs's goal is to sidestep the computational overhead
                            and memory footprint associated with software RTOSs
                            while increasing the flexibility and capabilities of
                            hardware RTOSs \cite{hartos}.
                        While not fully complete, HartOs is an innovation in the
                            development of hardware-based RTOSs.
                \end{itemize}
